The dataset is obtained from Kaggle and is already split into training and testing data.
It is about cold calling a customer and convincing them to buy the car insurance. 
The dataset has 19 attributes including the last attribute which is binary implying whether the customer has opted to purchase car insurance or not.
The problem I want to solve here is figuring out the cold call process which led the customer to buy the insurance and which led them to cancel it as well. 
The client here is the car insurance company and based on the analysis they can improve their approach of cold calls and they can look at the rejected calls and the solution provided to further improve their cold call campaign.
Iâ€™m planning to start with exploring the dataset and try to find patterns and correlations within the fields and visualize it to get a better idea first then applying machine learning predictive algorithms to model the dataset and come up with the best model to predict the cold call success using model accuracies, lift charts and confusion matrix.
The final output will be a presentation which tells about the insights from the dataset along with the clear cut report including visualization graphs and python notebook explaining the approaches I took with this dataset.
